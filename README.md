There are my notes from today's Git lesion.

- command p allows you to open files within git kraken
- commit files in groups that are useful

## Practice Markdown
I have lots to do today so thre is a To Do list:
- Have some lunch
- Head home and cycle
- Shopping on the way home
    + Red onion
    + 


### Markdown help
- one hash is level one heading, two is a level two etc
- dashes WITH A SPACE create a bullet list
- indentation and a plus creates a "sub-list"
