# Git Notes

## Intro to version control
R studio does have git support built into it if you want to do it that way
Can write wikis in github -> Have an explore

## Anatomy of a Github repository
- Readme file →  markdown
- License -> lots of standard ones to chose from out there
- contributing.md → people who have contributed to the project
- Code of conduct
- Issues -> tasks that need to be undertaken 

- .gitignore tells it to ignore certain files
    + Temporary files created by certain languages
    + LFS → large file system, git not designed for this, only use small text files, git is not for storing data, don’t need version control for your raw data

- command p allows you to open files within git kraken
- commit files in groups that are useful
    + eg after each chunk of R code eg once tidying up the data, after working on models, this makes it easier to spot where changes are leading to bugs etc
- using the dropdown at pull can use fetch which shows what changes have been made elsewhere but doesn't actually pull


## Markdown help
- one hash is level one heading, two is a level two etc
- dashes WITH A SPACE create a bullet list
- indentation and a plus creates a "sub-list"
